# Vachaka 🖐️🤖  
An AI-powered agent that translates **Sign Language into Text** in real-time, breaking communication barriers and enabling inclusivity.  

## ✨ Problem Statement  
Deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals face daily challenges in communicating with people who are not familiar with sign language. Existing solutions are often limited, inaccurate, or not scalable.  

## 💡 Our Solution  
**Vachaka** leverages **computer vision + deep learning** to recognize sign language gestures and convert them into real-time **text output**. The tool can be integrated into apps, browsers, and civic platforms to promote **accessibility and inclusivity** in education, healthcare, governance, and public services.  

## 🔬 Technical Approach  
- **Dataset:** Publicly available Sign Language gesture datasets (from Kaggle & other open sources).  
- **Preprocessing:** Image normalization, hand/gesture detection using OpenCV.  
- **Model:** Deep learning with CNNs for gesture recognition; fine-tuned with IBM Watson & Granite LLMs for better contextual accuracy.  
- **Frontend:** React-based UI for smooth, real-time interaction.  
- **Backend:** Python + Flask API with MongoDB for storing user logs/sessions.  

## 🚀 Built With  
- 🐍 **Python** – AI model training & backend  
- ⚛️ **JavaScript (React)** – Frontend  
- 📊 **Kaggle** – Dataset source & experiments  
- 🤖 **IBM Watson + Granite AI** – Contextual AI/NLP support  
- 🍃 **MongoDB** – Database  
- 👁️ **OpenCV** – Image preprocessing & gesture detection  

## 🌍 Impact & Significance  
- Improves accessibility for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community  
- Enables inclusivity in public services, education, and healthcare  
- Can be extended to **multilingual sign language translation**  
- Moves us closer to a **Solarpunk future** where AI empowers humanity  

## 🛠️ Future Scope  
- Real-time **speech-to-sign** (bi-directional communication)  
- Mobile app integration for accessibility on-the-go  
- Integration with smart glasses / IoT devices
